                  <p>Jude Alawa recently graduated from Yale University as a Global Health Scholar majoring in Global Affairs and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. 
                    He is from Miami, Florida by way of Damascus, Syria and is interested in the intersection between medicine and international relations, specifically with 
                    respect to humanitarian assistance and access to healthcare among marginalized populations. Jude has worked for the National Health Service in London evaluating
                     and implementing new models of community healthcare, for the Council on Foreign Relations researching domestic and global health policy, and for Pharos Global 
                     Health devising appropriate interventions to address international health disparities. Jude’s current work focuses on providing water purification devices to 
                     Syrian refugee camps and addressing interventions to improve chronic disease care among refugees. In the future, Jude hopes to study and craft effective measures
                      to improve clinical standards and increase access to healthcare in under-resourced communities at home and abroad. At Yale, Jude was active in the Yale 
                      Rotaract Club (Local/International Service), the Yale International Relations Association, Instrumental Connection (Music Instruction), and as a research assistant at the 
                    Yale Medical School. Next year, Jude will be pursuing his Masters in Public Health at the University of Cambridge as a Rotary Scholar and a Fox Fellow. </p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Our Making of the Mafia Crisis Committee will begin in 1931 and will track the rise of the five families and organized crimes. In 1931 Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring gangs into the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families. Members of the committee will represent leaders of their specific families as they work together to protect organized crime and work against each other to fight for control. </p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Jackson Arnberg is a senior at American Heritage and has been doing Model UN since freshman year.  He has won numerous Best Delegates all across the country, and has spoken at the United Nations building in New York twice.  While he has competed in many roles at over 15 conferences, he is a specialist on the topic of refugees.  He hopes that one day he’ll be able to make a tangible difference in the world.  Along with Model UN, he also plays varsity basketball and is looking to play at the next level, potentially at an Ivy League school.  He’s looking forward to an awesome conference weekend and meeting all the delegates</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Chair Bio</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The year is 1868, over two centuries since Tokugawa Ieyasu reunited Japan and inaugurated a period of peace and stability under the Tokugawa Shogunate. However, there is one eternal law: All that begins must end. The rude arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry opened Japan's long closed gates, leading to several unequal treaties and crises that have left the Shogunate humiliated in the face of the much stronger Western powers. Sensing the opportunity to exact their revenge, the old enemies of the Tokugawa have raised the banner of rebellion and vowed to restore the authority of Emperor Meiji, plunging the country into civil war. The actions taken by this committee - composed of those daimyo still loyal to Shogun Yoshinobu - will decide whether the Tokugawa Dynasty stands the test of time or scatters like another leaf in the wind.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The United Nations Human Rights Council will run as a specialized committee combining the traditional aspects of GA with the fast-paced responses of crisis, such as directives. Both topics will revolve around the application and adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in today’s society. The first topic deals with all aspects of women’s rights including social and legal treatment, economic autonomy, reproductive rights, educational access, and the influence of culture on the situation. The second topic will cover human trafficking focusing on Africa and neighboring regions as these areas have seen an increase in both sex trafficking and coerced labor. Delegates should be prepared to view the intersectionality of issues and create solutions which tackle both cause and effect. </p>

The First Committee of the General Assembly has addressed topics such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, disarmament and small arms, terrorism, and biological weapons. The topics that will be discussed in DISEC are international regulation for artificial intelligence and transnational organized crime.

He has won many awards across the country including Best Delegate. While he has competed in crises, he prefers General Assemblies due to the fact that GA’s tackle current, real world problems that do not get enough attention or are very difficult to solve. Along with Model UN, Logan is also very passionate about math and competes on the extremely successful math team at American Heritage. He also loves sports, both playing and watching, and is the statistician of the varsity football team. He’s looking forward to chairing DISEC and to an awesome AHPMUN VII!

                 <p class="item-intro text-muted">The globalization of LGBTQ+ poses to be a pressing issue to SOCHUM for two reasons. First, while acceptance of LGBTQ+ community members is definitely on the rise in some of the globe, many barriers are still present that create trouble for LGBTQ+ individuals. Second, legislative and public opinion change are both imperative to the success of LGBTQ+ populations; however, this community and their very relevant issues always seem to be placed on the backburner by both state and international organizations. The community’s threats are considered to be less important than issues that affect the global community, and to this date, the General Assembly has only ever once mentioned the LGBTQ+ community directly in a resolution. While the UN Human Rights Council has put in place protections for LGBTQ people in regard to discrimination and violence and has compiled a list of discriminatory laws and regulations, no concrete International action has been put in place on behalf of this community</p>
